                    <p>Database administrators are storage experts. They store and organize data so that users can access the information they need, while keeping unwanted visitors away. These it professionals play a vital role in many industries, such as
                        finance, transportation, healthcare and others. Websites that obtain and store confidential and private data. Database administrators supervise the development of new databases. When analyzing database requirements, they clarify
                        the goals to be achieved and identify their users. After the database is established, they monitor their performance and make improvements. Because many users rely on the database to complete their daily work, the database is regular
                        Administrators will back up the system to prevent data loss, and establish steps to ensure the integrity of the data entering the system. When a problem occurs, they have to find and repair it. Sometimes it is a very complex problem.

                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAzCBH_o7OE ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAzCBH_o7OE</a>
                    <p>David Finnigan(Database Administrator / ANZ)</p>
                    <p>Q1:What kinds of things do you do in a normal day?</p>
                    <p> DF: There are two things I do in a normal day &ndash; the first is to make sure that the databases I support are running quickly and that the appropriate people have access. I also make sure that any overnight jobs such as backups
                        or reports have finished successfully. And then the other thing that we look after is a lot of consultation with projects that might be intending to use databases in the future.</p>
                    <p>Q2:Why are databases important? </p>
                    <p>DF: I think databases are critical to a lot of modern organisations. It&rsquo;s probably not too big a stretch to say that no database, no oraganisation or no company. And as such a DBA has a large role to play if a database system
                        is down or even running slowly that can cause a big impact to customers and internal staff within an organisation, and as a result a DBA can make a really positive difference in truning that around and repairing it.</p>
                    <p> Q3:What&rsquo;s your favourite part of your job?</p>
                    <p> DF: I think repairing issues, addressing those sort of problems are one of my favourite parts; when something has gone wrong and it&rsquo;s impacting a lot of people, it&rsquo;s very rewarding to be able to apply to your knowledge
                        and skills and experience, and resolve that issue quickly. And to oftentimes literally hear the relief in the users&rsquo;s voices when your&rsquo;re able to tell them that it&rsquo;s working properly again.</p>
                    <p> Q4: How did you become a DBA </p>
                    <p>DF: I started in an IT support role like a lot of people do, and in the organisation I was working at that time they didn&rsquo;t have a dedicated DBA so I sort of organically moved into that area. The need was there and then I&rsquo;d
                        go to training courses and eventually just chose to specialise. </p>

                    <p> What kind of work is done by the IT professional? </p>
                    <p>Store and organize data so that users can access the information they need, while keeping unwanted visitors away. Responsibility for evaluating database software purchases. Oversee the modification of any existing database software
                        to meet the needs of their employer. Responsibility to maintain the integrity and performance of the company's database. Data must be secured and stored optimally. Notify end users of changes in the database and train them to use

                    <p> What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? </p>

                    <p>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</p>
                    <p> Make sure all night work (such as backup or reporting) has been successfully completed. Then, another thing that need to take care of is to negotiate extensively with projects that may intend to use the database in the future. &bull;

                        and investigate violations. They set up firewalls and perform data on some sensitive network information. encryption. They will simulate penetration testing, network attacks on their own networks, and look for other network vulnerabilities.
                        The responsibility of some network professionals is causing disaster. For network security professionals, they have obtained considerable job growth in the past. If there is a security breach, banks and financial institutions will
                        suffer huge losses. If some companies lose their data, then this company will be prosecuted and face huge fines.</p>

                    <p>Cyber security specialist work with organizations to ensure the security of their computer information systems. They determine who needs to access which information, and then plan, coordinate, and implement an information security
                        plan. They use a multi-layered approach, using their expertise and up-to-date knowledge to help defend against web threats that fuel cybercrimes, including malware, phishing, viruses, denial of service attacks, information warfare

                    <p>Nowadays, security has become so complicated that people have to focus on one or two areas instead of focusing on them. Therefore, I think the most difficult thing to become a security expert is to keep up with technological changes,
                        new solutions and persistent vulnerabilities. </p>

                    <p> What is the employment prospect of this position? </p>
