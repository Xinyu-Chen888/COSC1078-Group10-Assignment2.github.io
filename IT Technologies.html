                        <h2>1.Machine Learning</h2>
                        <p>Machine learning specializes in the study of how computers simulate or realize human learning behaviors to acquire new knowledge or skills and reorganize the existing knowledge structure to continuously improve its own performance.
                            The neural network of machine learning has reached the level of human ability in tasks such as language translation, object recognition, games, and even driving a car. Machine learning can be roughly divided into supervised
                            learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning and active learning tasks. Supervised learning is the task of learning the function of mapping input data to target tags. It comes with a labeled
                            training data set. These problems can be further classified as regression and classification problems. When the target variable is a continuous real value, the supervised learning tasks are called regression problems, and when
                            the target variable is a categorical variable, these tasks are called classification problems. Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression (LR), decision tree, random forest (RF), support
                            vector machine (SVM), nearest neighbor (KNN) and artificial neural network. RF and SVM are the most used algorithms. For now, in machine learning area, we have Automated Featurization process. This is an additional machine
                            learning feature that data scientists can use to enable or disable automatic functionalization and customize automatic functionalization settings for machine learning experiments. Whether it is searching online, consuming weather
                            reports, driving a car, or using voice recognition on a smartphone, all of them cannot leave from machine learning. For example, machine learning can be used in sales and marketing to predict which products customers are most
                            likely to buy. Take customer data as input and map it to the expected likelihood that the customer will respond to a given product. Then it can also be used for risk and fraud management. Machine learning in fraud detection
                            is usually used to map transaction descriptions to their possibilities to indicate whether ongoing transactions are highly likely to be fraudulent. In credit risk, it can map the details of loan applicants to the probability
                            that they will default on a given loan. It is also used in intelligent transportation. By using sensor data, accidents and road engineering to understand traffic patterns, traffic optimization can be achieved. Machine learning
                            models can predict delays or road obstacles and suggest faster routes for public buses and consumer and commercial vehicles. With the further development of neural networks and machine learning, future search engines will better
                            provide answers and insights that are highly relevant to users who are searching. The future of machine learning should include quantum algorithms, and quantum computers may be very good at processing high-dimensional vectors
                            in large tensor product spaces. The development of supervised and unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithms may greatly increase the number of vectors, and the dimensionality of the vectors will be much faster than traditional
                            algorithms. And cognitive services. This technology includes toolkits such as APIs and services, through which developers can create more discoverable smart applications. The machine learning application programming interface
                            will allow developers to introduce smart features such as emotion detection; voice, facial and visual recognition; and apply language and speech understanding to their applications. An unsupervised machine learning algorithm
                            and enhance CPU function to adapt to machine learning data processing. Azure Cognitive Services is a REST API that can expose machine learning models to the outside world. Applications can use Cognitive Service API methods
                            to get the desired output. Then QnA Maker can process the text, by extracting questions and answers from semi-structured content, you can use it to build a knowledge base. Use QnA's best answers in your knowledge base to automatically
                            answer user questions. Those will bring higher results to future development. </p>

                        <p>Machine learning has generated a lot of innovation and capabilities for future human work. It can simplify every stage of production. Use machine learning to simplify production can reducing unplanned machine downtime by 15% to
                            30%, increasing production throughput by 20%, reducing maintenance costs by 30%, and improving quality by 35%. And helps people do more of what they do best, such as strategic analysis and making judgments, thereby freeing
                            people from tedious work. Working with machines, the results produced by humans are much better than those done alone. It also has a potential impact of healthcare. Better use of medical data physicians gathers from their patient
                            population, in any form. This includes medical images, doctorsâ€™ notes, structured lab tests, and many other data inputs. Machine learning can take all of this data and using deep learning and image analysis make medical diagnostics
                            faster, more accurate, and more accessible. Product inspectors may be affected, because the use of deep learning-based systems can improve defect detection by up to 90% compared with manual inspections. But this is not a problem,
                            machine learning has the potential to reduce the long-term labor shortage in the manufacturing industry. Machine learning will not replace the existing jobs, but expand the jobs, implement human efforts rather than hinder them.
                            For example It can handle the arrangement of human resources functions, analysis and reporting of human resource data, simplify the work process, reduce staff turnover, enhanced rewards, measure and manage engagement and recognition
                            programs and personalized training, so that human resources employees who should have done these free up more time and resources for all important interpersonal interactions, and are more engaged Strategically significant projects.
                            , They will no longer need the ordinary, repetitive but indispensable human resource work that was previously needed in their daily work. </p>

                        <p>For me, the biggest impact of machine learning is that after I search for a product or watch a certain type of video, it will always be displayed according to my preferences. In this way, when I want to watch movie or video, I
                            can directly see what I need instead of searching slowly by myself. I use social software, such as Instagram. Instagram will constantly notice the friends I contact, the personal information I frequently visit, my interests,
                            places I have been, or groups that I share with others. Because of continuous learning, I suggest that you may become my Instagram friend. This is machine learning. And Facebook, when I upload a photo of me and my friend, Facebook
                            will immediately recognize my friend. Facebook will check the posture and projection in the picture, pay attention to these unique features, and then match them with the people in the friends list. Also, basically everyone
                            has an e-mail, so do I. I need an e-mail address for shopping or registration, and then I will receive a variety of advertising mails and spam, there may be hundreds of spam emails received every day. Machine learning can help
                            me automatically classify these spams, so I donâ€™t waste it Time slowly cleared up. For my mother, I think machine learning can help her detect fraudulent information on her mobile phone, because she cannot tell which is true
                            and which is false. With the aid of machine learning, fraud detection applications will become more and more accurate. When driving, she will use the online transportation map, machine learning can help estimate areas where
                            congestion may occur based on daily experience. Which helps prevent traffic jams and conduct congestion analysis to reduce the time to reach the destination, it can also minimize detours.</p>

                    <section id="Autonomous vehicles">
                        <a name="2"></a>
                        <h2>2.Autonomous vehicles</h2>
                        <p>2. Automatic vehicle rely on artificial intelligence, visual computing, radar, monitoring devices, and global positioning systems to work together, allowing safely operate motor vehicles without any human active operation. The
                            leader of autonomous driving has reached Level 4 technology, but only travels along a predetermined route under certain circumstances. These companies only provide campus shuttles or employee buses, and they are always equipped
                            with safety drivers. The self-driving cars that the public can buy, and use are still firmly at the level 3 technology. The current autopilot system technology can reach level 1-4, but level 5 has not been completed. Machine
                            learning is also a technical support it needs. This technology can help object detection, object recognition or recognition object classification, moving object positioning and prediction. Many automated car companies use machine
                            learning and artificial intelligence to build a simulation environment that allows cars to drive and quickly test rare scenarios or hardware adjustments. In this way, these cars of brands can know where to start construction
                            at an intersection or know the communities that are easily accessible to cyclists. Since imaging technology is a key technological driving force, it has become the most important limiting factor for mass production of level
                            3 and above autonomous vehicles. The development of sensor technology has always combined video, radar, ultrasonic sensors and lidar. However, this method was not successful. Glare, focus issues, depth perception challenges,
                            fog and heavy rain all hinder the accuracy of existing sensor technologies. Today the leading sensor technology method is thermal imaging. Thermal imaging sensors can detect longer wavelengths than in the spectrum and lower
                            than the wavelength of the image in the spectrum, making it able to detect people, animals and objects in heavy rain, fog and night. Automated cars can now provide automatic parking, driving assistance systems, and can provide
                            users with options for manual, semi-automatic and highly automatic driving. The automatic driving system can simultaneously perform cruise control, lane keeping, distance keeping and lane changing. In addition, the software
                            can also automatically steer on low-speed roads, called Autosteer +, and can also drive several kilometers to you when you call it. Although all three functions can be completed separately, the transition between these activities
                            still requires the driver, and in fact, the driver's hands are always on the steering wheel. In the next three years, the safety of automated driving should be greatly improved, and the accident rate should be reduced, achieve
                            higher level autonomous driving. In specific geographic areas, unmanned luggage vehicles, unmanned delivery vehicles, unmanned sweeping vehicles, unmanned shuttles, autonomous buses, autonomous wide-body dump trucks, autonomous
                            mining cards, and AVP functions can be used Passenger cars and other types. The driving environment in this area is single and the traffic situation is simple, with almost no or only a small number of outside vehicles and pedestrians
                            able to enter. Measurable image (DMI) is an emerging terrestrial stereo image information product, which can support direct browsing of the real environment and relative measurement of the height, width, area and other information
                            of the target feature. Use the vehicle navigation system to collect real-time images and match them with the pre-acquired measurable images, transfer the matched measurable image spatial position information to the real-time
                            image, and calculate the motion carrier through spatial coordinate transformation 'S current location. Localizing Ground-Penetrating RADAR is a technology that can make this a big leap, it sends radio waves to the ground, creating
                            a stable digital map of the ground that will not move or change, and is not affected by weather changes. By incorporating sensor data processing into the car's electronic control unit, it is essential to improve the utilization
                            of machine learning to complete new tasks. </p>

                        <p>Self-driving cars can save time for commuters, alleviate traffic congestion and improve traffic efficiency, reduce travel time and release hands. Also advanced driver assistance systems have the potential to reduce motor vehicle
                            deaths by 90%ï¼Œsave more people lives. Driverless car manufacturers promise that their products will be safe and reduce accidents. Drunk driving will become history. The incidence of danger may drop sharply, which will seriously
                            affect auto insurance companies. Among these advances in automotive technology, society is struggling to deal with one of the biggest challenges of the current era: climate change. Driverless cars, especially passenger cars,
                            will greatly affect the ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and move towards a carbon-free economy. If a user can use an app like Uber to summon a driverless car, then the user does not need to own his own car, let alone
                            multiple cars. The driverless car will pick you up, get off, and set off to accommodate another user or users. Therefore, many people who need to ride can share a dispersed fleet of driverless cars. If this happens, unless
                            manufacturers and dealers can adapt quickly, it will hurt sales of new and used cars. In the future, unmanned self-driving cars will replace jobs currently performed by workers, such as bus drivers and taxi drivers. Agriculture,
                            manufacturing, and construction workers can be replaced with automatic vehicles, which are designed to complete specific repetitive tasks in these areas. Among these workers, truck drivers are more susceptible to automation
                            because they mainly drive on highways, and this type of navigation is easier to automate than negotiating city streets. However, the driverless car industry is also creating job opportunities, especially as multiple companies
                            are racing to put the first self-driving car into practice. These companies are in urgent need of talents for the development of automated cars. </p>

                        <p>Autonomous cars can provide me with assistance while driving. For example, if I need to answer an important call or reply to a message, the automated driving assistance system can help me control the vehicle until the problem is
                            solved. The automatic parking system is very useful to me because I scratched someone elseâ€™s car when I was parking on the night of September 16th. The night was dark, and position is narrow. If there is an automatic parking
                            system, it is not a problem. It only needs radar to measure the position to automatically park. When driving, you do not need to control the speed by yourself, but hand it over to an autonomous car. In an unmanned vehicle,
                            you no longer need to pay attention to changing the speed limit on the route at any time. Instead, the vehicle will receive information through the air and adjust its speed accordingly. Not only can I reduce parking fines,
                            but also save my money. As car accidents decrease, insurance rates will also be greatly reduced. In addition, once the uniform cost of driverless sharing and mobility is established, the cost of car maintenance will drop sharply.
                            And if traveling with my family requires long-term driving, then an autonomous car can relieve our fatigue and take a rest. The whole family will look forward to the journey. I can choose to play games, read new books or watch
                            movies with my family, instead of scolding other drivers on the road, because driving will be irritable in certain situations. Since self-driving cars are expected to bring smoother traffic flow, we can even set off at a more
                            comfortable time of day.</p>

                    <section id=" Natural Language processing and chatterbots ">
                        <a name="3"></a>
                        <h2>3. Natural Language processing and chatterbots </h2>

                        <p>Natural Language processing and chatterbot is a computer program that conducts conversations via conversation or text. The chatbot can process user input in natural language and respond correctly. And include memory function, many
                            chatbots can remember some information about the user, such as name, gender or age. There are also contextual dialogues, which will not only consider the current user input, but also consider the previous messages sent by the
                            user or robot to provide users with a better experience. Currently, chatbots can be used for practical purposes, such as customer service or information acquisition. It is part of virtual assistants and can connect with many
                            organizations' applications, websites, and instant messaging platforms. In the next three years, chatbots should extend the use and interpretation of speech through natural language processing engines. Because today we not
                            only use typing, but also use voice to communicate with chatbots. To accomplish this goal requires highly rigorous scripting and expanding the complexity of the terminology used to interact with chatbots. Chatbots can bring
                            a lot of convenience to business and customers. It can enable businesses to save more labor. If customers need any help or find something, chat bots can answer them very soon. And it will also evaluate the shopping patterns
                            of customers to select similar shopping trends, saving their time to search things. Similarly, it saves labor, but also puts pressure on people in customer service positions. Although chat bots cannot replace manual customer
                            service now, it can solve some simple problems, so the required manual customer service will be reduced. Chatbots can help me find the answers I want simpler and intuitively. I am not good at communicating. Chatbots can help
                            me avoid this problem. And there is no need to wait for the answer from the human customer service, because sometimes it takes more than ten minutes to wait. My friend said that the chat bot allows her to ask questions at any
                            time, without waiting for special working hours, and the processing power is also high. Natural language processing (NLP) can overcome natural communication barriers. The same issues that plague our daily communication with
                            other people through text may also affect our interaction with chatbots. Examples of these problems include spelling and grammatical errors, and poor language use in general. Advanced natural language processing (NLP) features
                            can identify spelling and grammatical errors and allow chatbots to interpret your expected information even if they encounter errors. When it comes to chatbots, one of the most significant challenges is that users have a blank
                            palette of what the chatbot can say. Although you can try to predict what users will say and what they will not say, there will definitely be some conversations that you dream of wildly. Although Natural Language Processing
                            (NLP) certainly cannot work miracles and cannot ensure that a chatbot responds appropriately to every message, it is powerful enough to make a chatbot successful or not. Donâ€™t underestimate this critical and often overlooked
                            aspect of chatbots. It's so boring to interact with chatbots that only use professional sounds. Chatbots should actually talk like humans. This means they should joke like we do, use emojis often, and sometimes make typos.
                            Imagine how interesting and rewarding the chat will be then! Companies should prepare chat bots to change their tone from professional to casual in order to maintain customer engagement and interest. However, to conduct human-like
                            conversations, chatbots should have context awareness. For this kind of function, the use of NLP to train chatbots is essential. With NLP, chatbots can easily understand complex human language. Everyone has a different style
                            when expressing themselves. With NLP, chat bots can quickly grasp a person's personality and respond accordingly. In addition, chatbots can use NLP to better understand irony, humor, and other dialogue sounds. To be honest,
                            NLP gives chatbots its own personality. With the help of computational linguistics, context extraction, content summarization and sentiment analysis, NLP will help chatbots interpret the original text, process it and deliver
                            rich information to users.
                        </p>

                        <p>It can be explained from three aspects. First, explain from the big data itself. At present and for a long time in the future, we are in the stage of big data, and if big data wants to extract the value of data, it cannot do without
                            machine learning and artificial intelligence technology. Similarly, if artificial intelligence wants to show its advantages, it must be based on big data. At present, major companies have their own massive amounts of data and
                            use artificial intelligence technology to show value. However, in terms of the amount of data in this province, perhaps the largest amount of data should be the vast number of web pages on the Internet. The utilization of web
                            pages is still relatively shallow. These web pages still have great value for Internet giants such as Google and Baidu to be explored. Almost every web page has a certain amount of text content, and most web pages rely solely
                            on text to display their core content. The content is all natural language. Then the research value of natural language processing is quite obvious. If you want to deeply explore the value of web pages, you must have good natural
                            language processing methods. Second, explain from the artificial intelligence technology itself. Artificial intelligence technology is currently developing well, and the most popular should be in the image and voice directions,
                            and relatively shortcomings are found in the text processing direction. The first two will enter a relatively flat stage in terms of technology and talent. The processing of text is about to take the center stage. Third, from
                            the perspective of the term artificial intelligence itself. Letâ€™s not talk about the word artificial. For the word intelligence, if a machine wants to realize intelligence, if it canâ€™t even understand human language, how to
                            communicate well with humans and how to embody intelligence. You can't let the two machines crackle and exchange a lot of information, and then say that this is intelligence. Generally speaking, it is necessary and important
                            for artificial intelligence to understand the meaning of natural language by machines, and natural language processing will eventually take the center stage.
                        </p>

                        <p>Effects </p>
                        <p>1. The machine's understanding of natural language processing is the human's understanding of language itself.
                            <br /> In fact, human beings have always had a lot of confusion in the study of their own acquired ability, such as how to form knowledge, language and thinking in the brain, and so on. NLP technology is to start from scratch,
                            let humans see their most primitive acquisition process. I think this direction is the intersection of human brain science and AI in the future.
                            <br /> 2. The development of natural language processing can gradually replace humans and liberate labor. The question and answer system has been known from Baidu, which was human-based a few years ago, to the current intelligent
                            system and BERT. This is a classic alternative to labor. There are also chat robots to replace future customer service, and automatic writing robots to replace future journalists. All of this is actually the most attractive
                            part of AI at present, but it is also the most difficult place to break through.
                            <br /> 3. Communication problems The communication between humans and machines is divided into information retrieval and dialogue systems. People-to-people communication issues, machine translation, etc.
                            <br /> Efficiency issues Replace humans in some repetitive tasks, such as word segmentation, text summarization, intelligent writing, etc.
                            <br /> In short, the goal is to enable machines to process and understand human natural language, and a mature natural language processing system will bring great liberation to humans.

                        <h2>4. Robot </h2>
                        <p>With the rise of artificial intelligence, big data and Internet of things, robots will be more widely used. Moreover, with the early application experience in the industrial and military fields, as well as the application of intelligent
                            robots in all walks of life, in the military, manufacturing, medical, service and other aspects, the use of intelligent robots is becoming more and more extensive. The innovation and development of robots can be divided into
                            four stages. The first stage is the embryonic stage of development. In 1954, the first programmable robot was born in the United States. In 1958, the American inventor Engelberg established unimation company. At this stage,
                            the robot industry entered the practical stage. The second stage is the incubation period of industry. In 1962, AMF company produced the first cylindrical coordinate robot. In 1969, Japan developed the first robot to walk with
                            two arms. At this stage, with the development of computer technology, modern control technology, sensor technology, artificial intelligence technology, robot has also been rapid development. However, robots can only do some
                            simple actions, and it needs further research and development to replace labor with robots. The third stage is the period of rapid development. In this stage, with the development of sensing technology, including visual sensor,
                            non-visual sensor (force sense, touch sense, proximity sense, etc.) and information processing technology, there are sensory robots. For example, in 1984, the United States launched the medical service robot help mate, which
                            can deliver food, medicine and mail to patients in hospitals. In 1999, Sony Corporation of Japan launched the large-scale robot Aibo. Robots have also begun to be put into industrial use, and the annual growth rate of global
                            industrial robot sales is more than 17%. Robots can assist or even replace humans in completing dangerous, heavy and complex tasks, improve work efficiency and quality, serve human life, and expand or extend the scope of human
                            activities and capabilities. The fourth stage, intelligent application period. At this stage, with the iterative upgrading of perception, computing, control and other technologies, and the in-depth application of artificial
                            intelligence technologies such as image recognition, natural speech processing, and deep cognitive learning in the robot field, the service-oriented trend in the field of robot is increasingly obvious, and it has gradually
                            penetrated into every corner of social production and life. </p>

                        <p>In recent years, with the continuous progress of science and technology, the third generation of robots has been produced, that is, intelligent mobile robots. This kind of robot has strong self-adjustment and adaptability for all
                            kinds of environment, because it uses various kinds of sensor equipment, and can realize the function of information learning and fusion. Intelligent robot involves many key technologies, which are related to the intelligence
                            of intelligent robot. These key technologies mainly include the following aspects: Multi-sensor Information coupling technology, multi-sensor information fusion refers to synthesizing the sensing data from multiple sensors
                            to produce more reliable, accurate or comprehensive information. The multi-sensor system after fusion can more perfectly and accurately reflect the characteristics of the detection object and eliminate the uncertainty of information,
                            Path planning technology, the optimal path planning is to find an optimal path from the initial state to the target state in the robot workspace, which can avoid obstacles; robot vision technology, the work of robot vision
                            system includes image acquisition, image processing and analysis, output and display, The core task is feature extraction, image segmentation and image identification; intelligent control technology and intelligent control
                            method improve the speed and precision of robot; human-computer interface technology, human-computer interface technology is to study how to make people communicate with computer conveniently and naturally. </p>

                        <p>Robot technology continues to improve efficiency and productivity is a trend, and it has been going on for many years, and will continue to grow rapidly in the future. The rising human capital puts forward higher requirements for
                            efficiency, and the continuous maturity of technology makes the popularization of robots possible. Both jointly promote the rapid development of robot market in recent years. We summed up a few points about the impact of robot
                            development on human society. The first point is robots will increase more jobs. The development of robots will improve labor productivity and product quality, create more social wealth and provide more employment opportunities.
                            The second point is the development of robots may threaten the employment of some people. The development of robots will replace some simple workers, which will threaten the survival of human beings. Robots can be applied to
                            different fields, so they will replace some people's work and lead to unemployment. The third point is robots can improve social efficiency. The application of robots reduces the workload of human beings and solves some problems
                            that cannot be solved by human beings. For example, Ali's urban brain can optimize the time allocation at intersections, improve traffic efficiency, and make busy cities more intelligent. And the development of robots can promote
                            the innovation of enterprises. Many deployment and application of robot systems in enterprises have reduced the number of jobs with low operation technology, but at the same time, they have created new jobs with high technology
                            content and rich returns. For example, people are required to be responsible for robot system maintenance and system programming. These new positions not only fully reflect the value of human beings, but also can provide people
                            with higher wage returns. </p>

                        <p>Today, robots have been used in life. The most common voice assistant is a branch of robots. When we usually play with mobile phones, voice assistant has become one of the most practical and convenient functions. We can control
                            the voice of mobile phones at any time according to our own ideas, to realize our service needs for life. Especially for those with physical defects, voice assistant is the most practical robot for them. There is also a more
                            common is the etiquette robot, they are mainly used to answer questions. The etiquette robots are used in shopping malls to give directions to people. When my grandmother doesn't know the way in the mall, she can directly ask
                            the robot how to go to a certain store by voice, which is very convenient. The sweeping robot is also a kind of robot, and it is very useful in my daily life. Cleaning is a very troublesome thing, and it can automatically help
                            me clean the ground very clean. Because in our family, everyone is very busy and under great pressure, we don't have to worry about cleaning the house every day if we have a sweeping robot. Just program the robot to work on
                            a specific date or time and continue to live and work. So, we can focus on more important things. </p>
