                    <p>In this section I will describe four areas&#65306; </p>

                    <p>-Machine Learning </p>

                    <p>-Autonomous vehicles </p>

                    <p>-Natural Language processing and chatterbots </p>

                    <p>-Robot </p>

                    <p>1. Machine learning specializes in the study of how computers simulate or realize human learning behaviors to acquire new knowledge or skills and reorganize the existing knowledge structure to continuously improve its own performance.
                        For now, in machine learning area, we have Automated Featurization process. This is an additional machine learning feature that data scientists can use to enable or disable automatic functionalization and customize automatic functionalization
                        settings for machine learning experiments. Whether it is searching online, consuming weather reports, driving a car, or using voice recognition on a smartphone, all of them cannot leave from machine learning. With the further development
                        of neural networks and machine learning, future search engines will better provide answers and insights that are highly relevant to users who are searching. An unsupervised machine learning algorithm and enhance CPU function to
                        adapt to ML data processing, will bring higher results to future development. </p>

                    <p>Machine learning has generated a lot of innovation and capabilities for future human work. It can simplify every stage of production. Machine learning is reducing unplanned machine downtime by 15% to 30%, increasing production by 20%,
                        reducing maintenance costs by 30%, and improving quality by 35%. Product inspectors may be affected, because the use of deep learning-based systems can improve defect detection by up to 90% compared with manual inspections. But
                        this is not a problem, machine learning has the potential to reduce the long-term labor shortage in the manufacturing industry. </p>

                    <p>For me, the biggest impact of machine learning is that after I search for a product or watch a certain type of video, it will always be displayed according to my preferences. In this way, when I want to watch movie or video, I can
                        directly see what I need instead of searching slowly by myself. For my mother, I think machine learning can help her detect fraudulent information on her mobile phone, because she cannot tell which is true and which is false. </p>

                    <p> </p>

                    <p>2. Automatic vehicle rely on artificial intelligence, visual computing, radar, monitoring devices, and global positioning systems to work together, allowing safely operate motor vehicles without any human active operation. Sensors
                        are very important for autonomous vehicles, and today the leading sensor technology method is thermal imaging. Thermal imaging sensors can detect longer wavelengths than in the spectrum and lower than the wavelength of the image
                        in the spectrum, making it able to detect people, animals and objects in heavy rain, fog and night. Automated cars can now provide automatic parking, driving assistance systems, and can provide users with options for manual, semi-automatic
                        and highly automatic driving. In the next three years, the safety of automated driving should be greatly improved, and the accident rate should be reduced, achieve higher level autonomous driving. Localizing Ground-Penetrating
                        RADAR is a technology that can make this a big leap, it sends radio waves to the ground, creating a stable digital map of the ground that will not move or change, and is not affected by weather changes. </p>

                    <p>Self-driving cars can save time for commuters, alleviate traffic congestion and improve traffic efficiency, reduce travel time and release hands. Also advanced driver assistance systems have the potential to reduce motor vehicle deaths
                        by 90%&#65292;save more people lives. In the future, unmanned self-driving cars will replace jobs currently performed by workers, such as bus drivers and taxi drivers. Agriculture, manufacturing, and construction workers can be
                        replaced with automatic vehicles, which are designed to complete specific repetitive tasks in these areas. </p>

                    <p>Autonomous cars can provide me with assistance while driving. For example, if I need to answer an important call or reply to a message, the automated driving assistance system can help me control the vehicle until the problem is solved.
                        And if traveling with my family requires long-term driving, then an autonomous car can relieve our fatigue and take a rest. </p>

                    <p> </p>

                    <p>3. Natural Language processing and chatterbot is a computer program that conducts conversations via conversation or text. The chatbot can process user input in natural language and respond correctly. And include memory function, many
                        chatbots can remember some information about the user, such as name, gender or age. There are also contextual dialogues, which will not only consider the current user input, but also consider the previous messages sent by the user
                        or robot to provide users with a better experience. Currently, chatbots can be used for practical purposes, such as customer service or information acquisition. It is part of virtual assistants and can connect with many organizations'
                        applications, websites, and instant messaging platforms. In the next three years, chatbots should extend the use and interpretation of speech through natural language processing engines. Because today we not only use typing, but
                        also use voice to communicate with chatbots. To accomplish this goal requires highly rigorous scripting and expanding the complexity of the terminology used to interact with chatbots. </p>

                    <p>Chatbots can bring a lot of convenience to business and customers. It can enable businesses to save more labor. If customers need any help or find something, chat bots can answer them very soon. And it will also evaluate the shopping
                        patterns of customers to select similar shopping trends, saving their time to search things. Similarly, it saves labor, but also puts pressure on people in customer service positions. Although chat bots cannot replace manual customer
                        service now, it can solve some simple problems, so the required manual customer service will be reduced. </p>

                    <p>Chatbots can help me find the answers I want simpler and intuitively. I am not good at communicating. Chatbots can help me avoid this problem. And there is no need to wait for the answer from the human customer service, because sometimes
                        it takes more than ten minutes to wait. My friend said that the chat bot allows her to ask questions at any time, without waiting for special working hours, and the processing power is also high. </p>

                    <p>4.Robots have basic characteristics such as perception, decision-making, and execution. While Qobotix has developed a new system recently that enables robots to learn independently and the robot can learn from other robots. With today&rsquo;s
                        technology, robots can assist or even replace humans in completing dangerous, heavy and complex tasks, improve work efficiency and quality, serve human life, and expand or extend the scope of human activities and capabilities.
                        Since intelligent robots have been given the special justification of &quot;human&quot;, they certainly need to have a relatively perfect language function, so that they can communicate with humans in a certain or even perfect
                        language, so the improvement of the robot language function is the future a very important link. The language ability of an intelligent robot depends on the number of sentences stored in the database and the range of languages
                        it stores, so it is necessary to write a large number of words into the system. </p>

                    <p>Robot technology continues to improve efficiency and productivity is a trend, and it has been going on for many years, and will continue to grow rapidly in the future. Robots greatly reduce the employment of certain groups of workers.
                        It can do some dirty, dangerous, and dull work. Instead of humans to do work that may endanger lives, such as waste management, bridge inspections, etc. Therefore, jobs such as cleaners and inspectors may be affected. </p>

                    <p>The sweeping robot is also a kind of robot, and it is very useful in my daily life. Cleaning is a very troublesome thing, and it can automatically help me clean the ground very clean. Robots are now used in shopping malls to give directions
                        to people. When my grandmother doesn't know the way in the mall, she can directly ask the robot how to go to a certain store by voice, which is very convenient.</p>
