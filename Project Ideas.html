                    <h3>Overview </h3>
                    <p>This is an online travel software. When it is not convenient for people to go out, such as a rainstorm, sun exposure, special period (COVID-19), people can use this app to simulate travel, and make friends and chat. It makes users
                        travel at home through game way. The app uses a 2D map and panoramic map technology, and the user controls a villain to move in the application. And it's moving at real speed. Chat with people on the same screen and even chat in
                        the same area. </p>

                    <h3>Motivation </h3>
                    <p>During the covid19 epidemic, lockdown not only blocked the virus but also greatly affected people's social interaction. People stay at home, it's hard to make new friends, and they can't see the scenery around. People can only stay
                        at home and use traditional social software to make friends or watch photos outside, but traditional social software can't meet the real travel simulation, so we have this software. We hope that through this kind of friend-making
                        software that simulates real travel, people will be able to catch up with new friends and enjoy the scenery around them when they are blocked or hard to travel. During the covid19 epidemic, lockdown not only blocked the virus but
                        also greatly affected people's social interaction. It's not enough for people to stay at home and use traditional social software. This kind of friend-making software that simulates real travel may give people a glimpse. </p>

                    <h3>Description </h3>
                    <p>The biggest selling point of this software is an online travel and multiplayer online mode. When users use software to travel online, it is like playing Role-Playing Game. </p>
                    <p>The first is the online travel function. Each user builds and controls a simulation character of his own. The high degree of freedom character design allows users to create very personalized and interesting characters by pinching their
                        faces, including various kinds of robots, monsters, cute animals and other rich choices. If we want to do this, we need to use the software of rendering and making 3D animation based on PC system, like 3D Studio Max, often referred
                        to as 3ds Max or max, it is developed by Discreet. For example, using 3DMAX to create some base models, then use the shell modifier to modify the details of models. Finally, use Photoshop to color and optimize the model. </p>
                    <p>Users can control the movement of personages with rich personalities in the map, and the mobile mode within the application is carried out in the virtual model, such as walking, cycling, and airplane. All these vehicles run at pseudo
                        speed. When users move in the software at real speed and move in the street, they can see the same scene as in real life, like if they get to Sydney on software, they will see the Sydney Opera House, so as to achieve the feeling
                        of virtual tourism. This requires some technical support. At first, we need to use ‘laser point cloud technology’. The data points of each city can be obtained through the shooting of the acquisition vehicle, these data points
                        correspond to the coordinates, height and distribution of buildings in the city, these data points are used to form a data set, so as to establish a 1:1 3D model in the virtual space, just like Google Street View. The next step
                        is we have to use Unity to create a virtual world. Unity is a software for developing games, which include 3D Geometric Modeling System. In Unity, we use the collected data sets (laser point cloud technology) to create a virtual
                        space just like the Sandbox Game. In this virtual world, players can see the same urban landscape as in reality and players can use the third-person perspective of the 2D map to play, or the first person called the street view
                        to play. </p>
                    <p>The virtual world combines the real road and city characteristics, when users enter different areas, there will be different environmental effects triggered, simulate different climate, weather, including rainstorm, drought, desert,
                        snow. Users can punch in the application to travel around the world, including the pyramid, the Arc de Triomphe, the great wall and other famous scenic spots. We will give priority to making virtual 3D models for popular cities
                        and scenic spots, and users can switch scenes at any time on the software. For example, when a user wants to travel to Sydney, he can open the map of the software, select the exact location of Sydney, and then the scene on the
                        screen will switch to the location he wants to go. </p>
                    <p>There will be historical stories and records of each scenic spot in the virtual world, which will take users to understand why each scenic spot has become a classic. Provide some interactive features, like you can synthesize your own
                        photos into the scene or take some interesting photos. And linked with Google map, you can view the local real information, store links, and simulate the real shopping scene. This means that the links you click in the application
                        are all from the real information of Google map. You can shop in the online stores of merchants, and even buy special souvenirs from different places. And we will provide the link of each product. This means that even though you
                        are not out of the house, you can still shop like a real trip. </p>
                    <p>The software also provides open social function, players can see each other in a virtual world, and simulate the outdoor reality, users without adding friends can only chat with each other when the game characters are close Users can
                        initiate private chat with users around the role and add them as friends, or join public voice to chat with a range of partners. Users can invite other users to chat on the screen to simulate the scene of face-to-face chat. This
                        kind of virtual outdoor friend making method will make users look brand new. To meet the needs of users using the app to meet the face-to-face chat. And can chat with strangers in different places around the world, this new online
                        dating model will attract many young people to try. To enable users to communicate in the virtual world, we have to ensure that the software communicates with the server. Considering that the user experience and chat function of
                        virtual world require high response delay, TCP protocol is not suitable for our software and we are going to use UDP protocol which can greatly reduce the response delay. Also the software will provide offline mode so that users
                        can choose to play alone, refuse other people's information, and enjoy the pleasure of travelling alone. </p>
                    <p>At the same time, users also have their own friends’ system, which means that users can travel in groups with friends, chat and enjoy the scenery around. This group travel feature also allows you to find like-minded partners. </p>

                    <h3>Tools and Technologies </h3>
                    <p>Take pictures of street view by Panoramic Map Through the laser point cloud technology, the Panoramic Map car can get the three-dimensional data of the city street, and establish the three-dimensional model A large number of map data
                        need to be saved in a database SQL database is required to save data It needs GIS system processing, web technology, computer graphics, 3D simulation technology and virtual reality technology Mobile application development based
                        on Java. Understanding of Internet Protocol, such as TCL protocol, UDP protocol. And practiced enough to use 3D animation rendering and production software, like 3D Studio Max and Unity.</p>

                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p> The completion of the software can meet the needs of users who can export travel at home even if they cannot go out. Be able to maintain social needs in special times. And users will not feel the fatigue of travel when they use the
                        software to travel online, also users don't have to cost a lot of accommodation and travel expenses. Users don't have to pay high fees and don't feel tired, this will make more people feel the charm of travel and love it. Online
                        travel through game way which makes travel more interesting and more open to meet strangers during the journey. </p>
