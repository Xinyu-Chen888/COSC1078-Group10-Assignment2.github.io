                    <p>A: I think our team carried out its work in an orderly way. We assigned each person's work, and if we found any problem during the in-depth exploration of each part, we would timely discuss with the group members how to solve the problem.
                        For example, when it is found that the task distribution is not uniform, we will timely adjust the assigned tasks to ensure that everyone's work can be completed in a timely manner, and make the work distribution more even. I think
                        everyone is working well together and there is nothing to be improved. The work went well, too. Nothing special happened. </p>

                    <p>B: This is my first attempt at group work. I am still at the exploratory stage of the group system. First of all, in terms of the division of groups, I think our group is not completely reasonable, nor is it absolutely fair. But the
                        group members are very active. Discuss problems with other team members as they arise. Of course, this is not entirely reasonable and not absolutely fair and we have to get to the next step. Among them, some students took the initiative
                        to host the meeting and lead the thinking of the leaders. I think the atmosphere of our group is very good, everyone is working towards the same goal. In the case of leaders, what struck me was the absence of very strong leaders.
                        We do have a lot of different opinions, but they all communicate politely and equally. Besides, we try to solve the problems in the best and most efficient way. As this is the first time that I attended the group work and I feel
                        good during the group activities, I don&rsquo;t have any suggestions for the group work. Moreover, I have learnt a lot of from my teammates. For example, I can show my own opinions when the team don&rsquo;t have any other ideas.
                        The team might not accept my idea but this applies a new idea for group and we can more thing to do the brainstorm. </p>

                    <p>C: The missions in our group go well. It seems like that everything is on the track. However, I don&rsquo;t feel that people in the group are motivated. In my opinion, there are two goals to be achieved by organizing group cooperative
                        learning. First, learn to cooperate with others and master cooperative skills in the process of group cooperative learning. Second, it is to develop the wisdom of the group through cooperative learning, so as to solve the problem
                        with high quality and efficiency. On the basis of fully respecting students' personality, let's keep trying and summarizing our experience in practice. I think our group still has too little communication. I am not very active
                        in group activities. I think this is what we need to improve. Through my team, I learned to be flexible. Sometimes I think too rigid, I learned how to change my mind flexibly. </p>

                    <p>D: I think everything is going well in our group. Our team members can timely respond to the time of group meetings and analyze and discuss the questions raised by everyone. During the meeting, everyone was able to express their own
                        opinions and actively complete the assignments. When there is a problem with the distribution of content, people can respond to the meeting in time and find a solution together. And do the task assignment again. Everyone can finish
                        what they need to finish in time for the next meeting. I think we should be more motivated to come up with more ideas and not just talk about Assignment 1. This may be an area where we need to strengthen. In fact, I learned a lot
                        from the group discussion, such as how to assign tasks, how to motivate everyone and so on.</p>

                    <p>E: In our group, everyone is able to complete their assigned part well, which I think is very good. This proves that we are all working together towards a goal. I think what can be improved is that we need a better division of labor.
                        A good beginning is half done. In my opinion, it is necessary to make clear the cooperation mode and form of the team, the job method and operation requirements of each member in the team. This will make the group work more specific.
                        I think the good thing is that during the group discussion, no one deviated from the learning communication activities and did something unrelated to the study. In the team, I have learned more ways to communicate with others,
                        which will be of great help to my future work and study.</p>

                    <p>Group 10: In Group 10, there are people who are shy for the first time to participate in Group activities, and there are people who can lead the team. Group 10 has a good Group atmosphere. As everyone said, all the team members are
                        willing to accept the group work and can finish the assigned part in time. Group 10 has excellent organizational ability, and can timely organize meetings or discussions to solve problems when problems are found. At the same time,
                        Group 10 is also very capable. When problems are discovered, it can propose several different solutions to solve the problems and select the best solution. It is very difficult to achieve an extreme balance in a group, usually
                        only the members have no opinions, there is no need for task equality. Group 10 members are able to help each other. After completing your own part, be willing to help others who are in trouble and assist them. Based on everyone&rsquo;s
                        suggestions, Group 10 may need to work on the assignment detail deeply and make a better distribution at very beginning. Group learning means meeting different people with different experiences, different personalities and different
                        ideas. That's the best thing about Group 10. Everyone will be there to tolerate and listen. In Group 10, all characters, experiences and ideas are released and put to good use. For example, during the discussion of project idea,
                        each team member would introduce their own ideas and stories. Even though the ideas from two different fields are different, Group 10 will still respect everyone and integrate everyone's ideas to create the best team project idea.
