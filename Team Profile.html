                            years, from high school to university. Before I study information technology at RMIT, I studied programming in the RMIT foundation, about the C language. The interest in IT stems from the development of today's society and

                            courage to discover and accepts new things, I am more sensitive to visual things, i agree with this point because I will remember the people or things I have seen. but my creativity is not high enough. In a team, everyone has

                        <h2>Meng Wang</h2>
                        <p>Hello. My name is Liseana. I come from China. This is my first year in RMIT University and I am studying in Bachelor of Information Technology. I used to study in New Zealand about Supply Chain and Operation Management. I am an
                            outgoing and optimistic girl. As a student, I have the simple life. I like to use positive attitude towards to life. I have a strong ability to adapt and coordinate in case of problems. And I showed my ability of working in
                            my last internship. I have many hobbies. I like playing the Chinese Traditional Instruments, Guzheng and Zhongruan, and violin as well. Besides, I like playing badminton. Although I am not very good at playing badminton, I
                            still like to play with my friends and always try my best. </p>
                        <h4>test result</h4>
                        <p>
                            In Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test, it shows that I am INF. According to NF, tools and actions that people choose need to be accepted by others, although sometimes not as effective as tools that are not accepted. They are very confused by the utilitarian
                            behavior that is too indifferent or single-minded in the pursuit of effect, and they worry about the good aspects of human nature and therefore lose them. Their first concern is always to cultivate satisfactory interpersonal
                            relations. Their ideal is to help the people around them to get on well with each other so that they can work hard for the common good. In Learning Style test, the result shows that I am Visual. Visual at 50%, Auditory at 30%
                            and Tactile at 20%. I find it is quite true. I do find I always extract information from the images I remember. In Big five Personality test, it shows that my data in these five aspects are very close and there is no obvious
                            difference. Based on these results, I think I need to be more flexible instead of focusing on the rules. I need to learn the art of getting along with and communicating with people. I hope I can improve and gain something.

                        <p>My name is Jiaqi Li, I am from China. I was born on July 27, 1999, my student number is s3798766. I like IT and finance, I like stocks and hope to realize financial freedom soon, so that I can do whatever I want. I like strategy
                            games instead of seeking excitement, because it’s so cool to predict others’ predictions. </p>
                        <h4>test result</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Myers-Briggs test results shows show that I am good at sensing (56%) and perceiving (34%) while lacking extraverted (7%) and thinking (5%). So I need to think about more aspects while sensing. The learning style test results show My auditory, 45%),
                            extraversion(40%) and tactile(15%). My auditory and extraversion are relatively balanced. In addition, I did a social skills test, which shows that the score of comfort in social situation is 45, which is relatively balanced.
